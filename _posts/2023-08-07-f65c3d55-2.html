<p>Global organizations require global IT infrastructure to support their processes, and APIs are no exceptions to this requirement.
In Part 2 of this blog post series, we will discuss the solution design and the implementation steps for the business requirements discussed in <a href="/f65c3d55-1.html">Part 1</a>.</p>

<h4><a name="solution-design">Solution design</a></h4>

<p>After thorough analysis of the requirements and available <a href="https://docs.mulesoft.com/cloudhub-2/ch2-architecture#regions-and-dns-records">CloudHub regions</a>, the ACME Inc. <em>Center for Enablement (C4E)</em> has come up with the following Solution Design.</p>

<h5><a name="solution-design-diagram">Solution design diagram</a></h5>

<p>The diagram below shows the solution design and the components required for the implementation. Applications will (continue to) use the vanity domain <em>api.acme.com</em>, 
  whereby Route 53 will be configured to ensure geographical routing based on the application's location.</p>

<h4><a name="implementation-plan">Implementation plan</a></h4>

<p>The C4E has also created an Implementation Plan, as described below.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create Private Spaces in Regions <em>eu-central-1 (deu-c1)</em> and <em>us-east-1 (usa-e1)</em></li>
  <li>Check configuration of AWS Route 53 Hosted Zone</li>
  <li>Create TLS Context</li>
  <li>Check configuration of existing VPC and DLB in Region <em>ap-northeast-2 (au-s1)</em></li>
  <li>Deploy <em>Orders API</em> to the three environments</li>
  <li>Configure AWS Route 53 with required DNS Records and geolocation policies</li>
</ol>

<p>Now let's get started with the implementation!</p>

<h5>Create Private Spaces in Anypoint Platform</h5>

  <ol>
    <li>Create a Private Space in Region <em>Europe (Frankfurt)</em> by following the steps described <a href="https://docs.mulesoft.com/cloudhub-2/ps-create-configure">here</a>.</li>

    The team decides to name this Private Space <em>acme-priv-sp-deu-c1</em>.
    <li>Create a Private Space in Region <em>US East (Northern Virginia)</em> following the same steps as above.</li>

    The team decides to name this Private Space <em>acme-priv-sp-usa-e1</em>
  </ol>

<p>The creation of the Private Spaces runs in the background and will take approximately 30 minutes to complete.

<h5>Check configuration AWS Route 53 Hosted Zone</h5>
<p>AWS Route 53 uses <em>Hosted Zones</em> for the management of a Top-Level Domain (TLD). ACME Inc. is already using AWS Route 53 for the management of their
domain <em>acme.com</em>, so in this case the team does not need to create a new Hosted Zone.</p>

<p>You can follow the steps described <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/CreatingHostedZone.html">here</a> to create a Hosted Zone for your own domain.
   Please note that using services in AWS Route 53, e.g. domain registration, DNS queries etc. are subject to the corresponding fees, which you will have to pay for.</p>

<h5>Create TLS Context</h5>
<p>The C4E at ACME Inc. has already gathered the needed PEM-files from their networking team to configure the Private Space with a TLS Context 
  for <em>api.acme.com</em>. They configure both Private Spaces following the steps described <a href="https://docs.mulesoft.com/cloudhub-2/ps-config-domains#create-tls-context">here</a>.</p>

<h5>Check configuration of existing VPC and DLB</h5>
<p>The C4E has decided to deploy the Orders API with the application name <em>acme-inc-orders-api</em> in all environments. As this name is available and unique inside the VPC,
  and the mapping rule inside the DLB has already been set up to forward API calls to the corresponding Mule App, no further changes are needed.

While they are checking the configuration in <em>Runtime Manager > Load Balancers</em>, they make note of the DLB's domain, which they need to configure the DNS Records.
</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="/assets/images/f65c3d55-2-dlb.png" alt="Dedicated Load Balancer domain" /></p>

<hr />

<h5>Deploy the <em>Orders API</em></h5>
<p>The C4E goes ahead and deploys the <em>Orders API</em> to the 2 Private Spaces in Frankfurt and Northern Virginia and to the VPC in Australia, a major milestone! Since API Security is of course
  highly important, they also created 3 APIs in API Manager and connected these to the Mule Apps using the <em>ApiId</em>, and implemented the Client ID enforcement policy. Lastly, they created an 
  API Group in API Manager and bundled all 3 API instances in the group, so that one set of credentials can be used to access all global API instances. With this in place, they can
  provide their customer with all the flexibility needed to call the API from any geographical location.</p> 

<p>After some sanity checks and test calls, all signs are green to go ahead with the global implementation.</p>

<h5>Configure AWS Route 53</h5>
<p>Now it's time to bring it all together. The C4E collaborates with the networking team to configure AWS Route 53.</p>

<p>First, the team gathers the required network configuration information for both of the Private Spaces, especially the <em>Public DNS Target</em>, which
they will need to configure the DNS Records.</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="/assets/images/f65c3d55-2-private-space.png" alt="Private Space configuration" /></p>

<hr />

<p>Then, the team creates a DNS Record in AWS Route 53 using the gathered information as depicted below.</p>

<hr />

<caption>Figure 4: DNS Record</caption>
<p><img src="/assets/images/f65c3d55-2-dns.png" alt="DNS Record" /></p>

<hr />

<p>Record Name: api<br>
Record Type: CNAME<br>
Value: xxxx.deu-c1.cloudhub.io<br>
Routing Policy: Geolocation<br>
Location: Europe<br>
Record ID: 20230810-132419</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> it can take up to 24 hours to propagate the DNS record to all global DNS servers.</p>

<p>To check whether the DNS record is available, you can run the Terminal command as shown below. The CNAME record should point to the CloudHub Public DNS Target,
  and in turn, the A Records should correspond with the Inbound Static IPs.</p>

<pre>
  user@laptop: ~ $ dig api.acme.com
  
  ; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> api.acme.com
  ;; global options: +cmd
  ;; Got answer:
  ...

  ;; ANSWER SECTION:
  api.acme.com.	60	IN	CNAME	xxxx.deu-c1.cloudhub.io.

  xxxx.deu-c1.cloudhub.io. 60	IN	A	10.0.0.2

</pre>

<p>Basically, the DNS Record will ensure that a call to the domain <em>api.acme.com</em> will be routed to the CloudHub domain in Europe (Frankfurt) where the Orders API is running, <em>if</em> the call originates from an IP Address residing in Europe.</p>

<p>The table below provides an overview of all DNS records created to complete the implementation. The team also added a CNAME Record with Geolocation <em>Default</em> to ensure that calls originating from a different continent or from an non-identifiable IP Address are routed to the Orders API running in North America. </p>

<h4><a name="conclusion">Conclusion</a></h4>

<p>The leadership team at ACME Inc. is very impressed and happy with the solution created by the C4E, and is confident it will be of great value to their customers.
The C4E has successfully implemented a global and scalable solution, that ensures fast response times from any geographical location, in turn providing an excellent
customer and developer experience. Using <a href="https://geopeeker.com">Geopeeker</a>, the team double-checks the global response times and DNS resolution, and sees everything is working as intended.</p>

<hr />

<p>As soon as the implementation is completed, the team notices that the operating costs on AWS Route 53 continue to increase, so they do make one small change. They decide to adjust
the <em>Time-to-Live (TTL)</em> of each CNAME Record to 86,400 seconds (or 1 day) to increase the cache period and reduce the number of queries made by clients against the DNS Service, in turn reducing operating costs.
It is indeed common practice to first configure the records with a short TTL, and increase it as soon as everything is configured as required.</p>

<p>And there you have it: we have successfully created Private Spaces, globally deployed our Orders API and built an application network that can be reached by customers throughout the world!</p>
